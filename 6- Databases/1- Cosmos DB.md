### Cosmos DB

## Synchronization
    - Easy with Cosmos: Traditional databases that weren't cloud enabled could be very difficult to set up across multiple regions. Azure takes care of all of it with Cosmos.
    - One Click to Add Regions: It is very easy to expand to more regions with Cosmos DB and have the data stay in sync.
    - Continued Synchranization: Cosmos DB stays on top of all reads and writes to your data and makes sure data is moved between regions to stay in sync.

## Latency
Cosmos DB promises single-digit milisecond latency anywhere in the world. (0-9 ms)

## Scalability
    - Automated: Cosmos DB automatically scale to meet resources demand.
    - Infinite Resources: Any number of users of application can be supported.
    - Lowest price: Even though the scaling is automatic, you only pay for the resources you use.
