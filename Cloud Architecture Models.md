### Cloud Architecture Models

## Private Cloud
Private cloud is Azure on your hardware in a location of your choise. All the benefits of public cloud, but you can lock it down. A lot of staff required.

## Public Cloud
Public cloud is Azure, AWS, GCP. No upfront costs, but monthly usage. Little control over services and infrastructure.

## Hybrid Cloud
A Hyrid cloud model is a best of private and public, but could be complex.
