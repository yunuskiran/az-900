Core Concepts:
- High Availability means systems are always available - even automatically.

- Reliability (a.k.a Fault Tolerance/Disaster Recovery) means how Azure can tolerate failures or even disaster.
      + Resilience
      + Deploy Mutliple Locations
        - Global-Scale Computing
        - Protects againist regional failure/disaster
      + No Single Point of Failure
        - Resources multiple locations
        - If one computer goes down, others pick up the load

- Scalability refers to scaling out or scaling up while automatically providing resorces as needed.
  + Scaling out (Horizantal Scaling): Mutliple same resources
  + Scaling up (Vertical Scaling): Increasing the power of (Cpu,Ram) of existing VMs

- Predictability is knowing your application will always perfom as expected and knowing what it will costs.
  + Predictable Performance and Costs

- Security is having full control of your cloud security posture.

- Governance is standardizing cloud deployments to meet requirement/company standarts.

- Manageability is management of cloud resources and how we interact with them.
